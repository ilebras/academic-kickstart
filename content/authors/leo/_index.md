Leo Middleton is a Postdoctoral Investigator at WHOI, working with Dr. Tom Farrar and Dr. Isabela Le Bras. His PhD was joint between the British Antarctic Survey and the University of Cambridge, studying the impact of small-scale turbulent mixing on the melting of Antarctic Ice Shelves. His current research concerns the impacts of small-scale turbulent mixing and stirring on the Polar Oceans, using novel ocean observing techniques. He is interested in ocean turbulence, submesoscale dynamics and ice-ocean interactions. Publications are [here.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MUkroM4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)

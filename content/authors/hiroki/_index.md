Hiroki Nagao is a PhD student in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program who is interested in 
observational studies of large-scale ocean circulation in the high latitudes. His work centers 
around ventilation processes in the Subpolar North Atlantic and their role in transporting carbon 
and oxygen from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. In addition to research, he is passionate in 
scientific communication and outreach activities.

Our lab is focused on observing ocean circulation and understanding its underlying physics. Ultimately, we seek to quantify the role of ocean circulation in the climate system. Specific areas of interest include:

- The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), an intricate system of currents that stabilizes the earthâ€™s climate by redistributing heat, salt, oxygen, and carbon on a global scale.

- High-latitude ocean dynamics and the linkages between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans.

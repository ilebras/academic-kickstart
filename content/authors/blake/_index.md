#Leo Middleton is a Postdoctoral Investigator at WHOI, working with Dr. Tom Farrar and Dr. Isabela Le Bras. His PhD was joint between the British Antarctic Survey and the University of Cambridge, 
#studying the impact of small-scale turbulent mixing on the melting of Antarctic Ice Shelves. His current 
#research concerns the impacts of small-scale turbulent mixing and stirring on the Polar Oceans, using novel ocean observing techniques. 
#He is interested in ocean turbulence, submesoscale dynamics and ice-ocean interactions. Publications are [here.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MUkroM4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)

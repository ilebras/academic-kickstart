Marta Faulkner is a PhD student in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program studying physical oceanography with Dr. Michael Spall and Dr. Isabela Le Bras. Her research focuses on large-scale Arctic Ocean physical oceanography, particularly the dynamics of the Beaufort Gyre in the Arctic’s Canadian Basin. She also has interests in sea ice, glacier-ocean interactions, and Antarctic physical oceanography. Personal website: https://mmfaulkner.github.io/.

The subpolar North Atlantic Ocean occupies a key role in regional and global climate, yet is poorly
represented in climate models, which limits our confidence in predictions. Recent Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program [(OSNAP)](http://www.o-snap.org) and other
data reveal significant subpolar ocean variability, but raise questions about the processes that give
rise to this variability and that link it to atmospheric changes. We bring the observations together
with numerical ocean and climate models to make a step change in our understanding of subpolar
North Atlantic variability by exposing the time-dependent causal relationships governing
subpolar ocean variability, their robustness across models and their implications for
predictability.

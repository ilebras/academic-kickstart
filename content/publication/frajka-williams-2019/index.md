abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) extends from the
  Southern Ocean to the northern North Atlantic, transporting heat northwards throughout
  the South and North Atlantic, and sinking carbon and nutrients into the deep ocean.
  Climate models indicate that changes to the AMOC both herald and drive climate shifts.
  Intensive trans-basin AMOC observational systems have been put in place to continuously
  monitor meridional volume transport variability, and in some cases, heat, freshwater
  and carbon transport. These observational programs have been used to diagnose the
  magnitude and origins of transport variability, and to investigate impacts of variability
  on essential climate variables such as sea surface temperature, ocean heat content
  and coastal sea level. AMOC observing approaches vary between the different systems,
  ranging from trans-basin arrays (OSNAP, RAPID 26 N, 11 S, SAMBA 34.5 N) to arrays
  concentrating on western boundaries (e.g., RAPID WAVE, MOVE 16 N). In this paper,
  we outline the different approaches (aims, strengths and limitations) and summarize
  the key results to date. We also discuss alternate approaches for capturing AMOC
  variability including direct estimates (e.g., using sea level, bottom pressure,
  and hydrography from Lagrangian floats), indirect estimates applying budgetary approaches,
  state estimates or ocean reanalyses, and proxies. Based on the existing observations
  and their results, and the potential of new observational and formal synthesis approaches,
  we make suggestions as to how to evaluate a comprehensive, future-proof observational
  network of the AMOC to deepen our understanding of the AMOC and its role in global
  climate.

abstract: 'The structure, transport, and seasonal variability of the West Greenland
  boundary current system near Cape Farewell are investigated using a high-resolution
  mooring array deployed from 2014 to 2018. The boundary current system is comprised
  of three components: the West Greenland Coastal Current, which advects cold and
  fresh Upper Polar Water (UPW); the West Greenland Current, which transports warm
  and salty Irminger Water (IW) along the upper slope and UPW at the surface; and
  the Deep Western Boundary Current, which advects dense overflow waters. Labrador
  Sea Water (LSW) is prevalent at the seaward side of the array within an offshore
  recirculation gyre and at the base of the West Greenland Current. The 4-yr mean
  transport of the full boundary current system is 31.1 ± 7.4 Sv (1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1),
  with no clear seasonal signal. However, the individual water mass components exhibit
  seasonal cycles in hydrographic properties and transport. LSW penetrates the boundary
  current locally, through entrainment/mixing from the adjacent recirculation gyre,
  and also enters the current upstream in the Irminger Sea. IW is modified through
  air–sea interaction during winter along the length of its trajectory around the
  Irminger Sea, which converts some of the water to LSW. This, together with the seasonal
  increase in LSW entering the current, results in an anticorrelation in transport
  between these two water masses. The seasonality in UPW transport can be explained
  by remote wind forcing and subsequent adjustment via coastal trapped waves. Our
  results provide the first quantitatively robust observational description of the
  boundary current in the eastern Labrador Sea.'

abstract: The standard view of the overturning circulation emphasizes the role of
  convection, yet for waters to contribute to overturning, they must not only be transformed
  to higher densities but also exported equatorward. From novel mooring observations
  in the Irminger Sea (2014–2016), we describe two water masses that are formed by
  convection and show that they have different rates of export in the western boundary
  current. Upper Irminger Sea Intermediate Water appears to form near the boundary
  current and is exported rapidly within 3 months of its formation. Deep Irminger
  Sea Intermediate Water forms in the basin interior and is exported on longer time
  scales. The subduction of these waters into the boundary current is consistent with
  an eddy transport mechanism. Our results suggest that light intermediate waters
  can contribute to overturning as much as waters formed by deeper convection and
  that the export time scales of both project onto overturning variability.

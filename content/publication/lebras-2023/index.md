abstract: From 2004 to 2014, the Line W moorings measured a 0.7 Sv yr-1 slowing of
  the deep western boundary current (DWBC) offshore of Cape Cod. Here, we combine
  these deep mooring observations with float and satellite altimeter data and find
  that this DWBC change corresponded to a slowing of the cross-basin Atlantic Meridional
  Overturning Circulation (AMOC) of about 0.3 Sv yr-1. Our AMOC transport time series
  corresponds well with the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean state
  estimate, particularly when the Line W mooring data influences our volume closure.
  We compare our 35° N time series with a similar time series at 41° N as well as
  the 26° N RAPID AMOC, and find AMOC declines across datasets from 2004 to 2014.
  However, when we extend our analysis to 2004– 2019, there are no significant trends
  at any latitude. These observations suggest that AMOC decadal variability is meridionally
  coherent from 26° N to 41° N and that the DWBC may reflect this variability.

abstract: The Greenland Ice Sheet is losing mass at an accelerating pace, increasing
  its contribution to the freshwater input into the Nordic Seas and the subpolar North
  Atlantic. It has been proposed that this increased freshwater may impact the Atlantic
  Meridional Overturning Circulation by affecting the stratification of the convective
  regions of the North Atlantic and Nordic Seas. Observations of the transformation
  and pathways of meltwater from the Greenland Ice Sheet on the continental shelf
  and in the gyre interior, however, are lacking. Here, we report on noble gas derived
  observations of submarine meltwater distribution and transports in the East and
  West Greenland Current Systems of southern Greenland and around Cape Farewell. In
  southeast Greenland, submarine meltwater is concentrated in the East Greenland Coastal
  Current core with maximum concentrations of 0.8%, thus significantly diluted relative
  to fjord observations. It is found in water with density ranges from 1,024 to 1027.2
  kg m-3 and salinity from 30.6 to 34, which extends as deep as 250 m and as far offshore
  as 60 km on the Greenland shelf. Submarine meltwater transport on the shelf averages
  5.0 textpm 1.6 mSv which, if representative of the mean annual transport, represents
  60%--80% of the total solid ice discharge from East Greenland and suggests relatively
  little offshore export of meltwater east and upstream of Cape Farewell. The location
  of the meltwater transport maximum shifts toward the shelfbreak around Cape Farewell,
  positioning the meltwater for offshore flux in regions of known cross-shelf exchange
  along the West Greenland coast.

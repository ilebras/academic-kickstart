abstract: Changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, which have the
  potential to drive societally-important climate impacts, have traditionally been
  linked to the strength of deep water formation in the subpolar North Atlantic. Yet
  there is neither clear observational evidence nor agreement among models about how
  changes in deep water formation influence overturning. Here, we use data from a
  trans-basin mooring array (OSNAP—Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program)
  to show that winter convection during 2014–2018 in the interior basin had minimal
  impact on density changes in the deep western boundary currents in the subpolar
  basins. Contrary to previous modeling studies, we find no discernable relationship
  between western boundary changes and subpolar overturning variability over the observational
  time scales. Our results require a reconsideration of the notion of deep western
  boundary changes representing overturning characteristics, with implications for
  constraining the source of overturning variability within and downstream of the
  subpolar region. Western boundary current variability in the subpolar North Atlantic
  is thought to reflect interior convection changes and determine Atlantic Meridional
  Overturning Circulation variability. Here, the authors show with an extended OSNAP
  time series that neither linkage is robust due to the complex dynamics in the region.

abstract: The subpolar North Atlantic is a site of significant carbon dioxide, oxygen,
  and heat exchange with the atmosphere. This exchange, which regulates transient
  climate change and prevents large-scale hypoxia throughout the North Atlantic, is
  thought to be mediated by vertical mixing in the ocean's surface mixed layer. Here
  we present observational evidence that waters deeper than the conventionally defined
  mixed layer are affected directly by atmospheric forcing in this region. When northerly
  winds blow along the Irminger Sea's western boundary current, the Ekman response
  pushes denser water over lighter water, potentially triggering slantwise convection.
  We estimate that this down-front wind forcing is four times stronger than air– sea
  heat flux buoyancy forcing and can mix waters to several times the conventionally
  defined mixed layer depth. Slantwise convection is not included in most large-scale
  ocean models, which likely limits their ability to accurately represent subpolar
  water mass transformations and deep ocean ventilation.

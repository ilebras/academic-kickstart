abstract: Fresh Arctic waters flowing into the Atlantic are thought to have two primary
  fates. They may be mixed into the deep ocean as part of the overturning circulation,
  or flow alongside regions of deep water formation without impacting overturning.
  Climate models suggest that as increasing amounts of fresh water enter the Atlantic,
  the overturning circulation will be disrupted, yet we lack an understanding of how
  much fresh water is mixed into the overturning circulation's deep limb in the present
  day. To constrain these fresh water pathways, we build steady-state volume, salt,
  and heat budgets east of Greenland that are initialized with observations and closed
  using inverse methods. Fresh water sources are split into oceanic Polar Waters from
  the Arctic and surface fresh water fluxes, which include net precipitation, runoff,
  and ice melt, to examine how they imprint the circulation differently. We find that
  65 mSv of the total 110 mSv of surface fresh water fluxes that enter our domain
  participate in the overturning circulation, as do 0.6 Sv of the total 1.2 Sv of
  Polar Waters that flow through Fram Strait. Based on these results, we hypothesize
  that the overturning circulation is more sensitive to future changes in Arctic fresh
  water outflow and precipitation, while Greenland runoff and iceberg melt are more
  likely to stay along the coast of Greenland.

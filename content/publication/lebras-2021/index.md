abstract: Abstract Fresh Arctic waters flowing into the Atlantic are thought to have
  two primary fates. They may be mixed into the deep ocean as part of the overturning
  circulation, or flow alongside regions of deep water formation without impacting
  overturning. Climate models suggest that as increasing amounts of freshwater enter
  the Atlantic, the overturning circulation will be disrupted, yet we lack an understanding
  of how much freshwater is mixed into the overturning circulation's deep limb in
  the present day. To constrain these freshwater pathways, we build steady-state volume,
  salt, and heat budgets east of Greenland that are initialized with observations
  and closed using inverse methods. Freshwater sources are split into oceanic Polar
  Waters from the Arctic and surface freshwater fluxes, which include net precipitation,
  runoff, and ice melt, to examine how they imprint the circulation differently. We
  find that 65 mSv (1 Sv $â‰¡$ 106 m3 s-1) of the total 110 mSv of surface freshwater
  fluxes that enter our domain participate in the overturning circulation, as do 0.6
  Sv of the total 1.2 Sv of Polar Waters that flow through Fram Strait. Based on these
  results, we hypothesize that the overturning circulation is more sensitive to future
  changes in Arctic freshwater outflow and precipitation, while Greenland runoff and
  iceberg melt are more likely to stay along the coast of Greenland.

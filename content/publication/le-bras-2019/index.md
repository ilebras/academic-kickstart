abstract: To ground truth the large-scale dynamical balance of the North Atlantic
  subtropical gyre with observations, a barotropic vorticity budget is constructed
  in the ECCO state estimate and compared with hydrographic observations and wind
  stress data products. The hydrographic dataset at the center of this work is the
  A22 WOCE section, which lies along 668W and creates a closed volume with the North
  and South American coasts to its west. The planetary vorticity flux across A22 is
  quantified, providing a metric for the net meridional flow in the western subtropical
  gyre. The wind stress forcing over the subtropical gyre to the west and east of
  the A22 section is calculated from several wind stress data products. These observational
  budget terms are found to be consistent with an approximate barotropic Sverdrup
  balance in the eastern subtropical gyre and are on the same order as budget terms
  in the ECCO state estimate. The ECCO vorticity budget is closed by bottom pressure
  torques in the western subtropical gyre, which is consistent with previous studies.
  In sum, the analysis provides observational ground truth for the North Atlantic
  subtropical vorticity balance and explores the seasonal variability of this balance
  for the first time using the ECCO state estimate. This balance is found to hold
  on monthly time scales in ECCO, suggesting that the integrated subtropical gyre
  responds to forcing through fast barotropic adjustment.

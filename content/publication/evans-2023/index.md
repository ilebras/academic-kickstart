abstract: The overturning streamfunction as measured at the OSNAP (Overturning in
  the Subpolar North Atlantic Program) mooring array represents the transformation
  of warm, salty Atlantic Water into cold, fresh North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW).
  The magnitude of the overturning at the OSNAP array can therefore be linked to the
  transformation by air--sea buoyancy fluxes and mixing in the region north of the
  OSNAP array. Here, we estimate these water mass transformations using observational-based,
  reanalysis-based and model-based datasets. Our results highlight that air--sea fluxes
  alone cannot account for the time-mean magnitude of the overturning at OSNAP, and
  therefore a residual mixing-driven transformation is required to explain the difference.
  A cooling by air--sea heat fluxes and a mixing-driven freshening in the Nordic Seas,
  Iceland Basin and Irminger Sea precondition the warm, salty Atlantic Water, forming
  subpolar mode water classes in the subpolar North Atlantic. Mixing in the interior
  of the Nordic Seas, over the Greenland--Scotland Ridge and along the boundaries
  of the Irminger Sea and Iceland Basin drive a water mass transformation that leads
  to the convergence of volume in the water mass classes associated with NADW. Air--sea
  buoyancy fluxes and mixing therefore play key and complementary roles in setting
  the magnitude of the overturning within the subpolar North Atlantic and Nordic Seas.
  This study highlights that, for ocean and climate models to realistically simulate
  the overturning circulation in the North Atlantic, the small-scale processes that
  lead to the mixing-driven formation of NADW must be adequately represented within
  the model's parameterisation scheme.

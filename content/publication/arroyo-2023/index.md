abstract: The Arctic Ocean's Canada Basin (CB) has seen significant changes in ocean
  properties in the past two decades. A prominent change has been a warming of the
  Pacific Summer Water (PSW) layer in the central CB. The corresponding change in
  dissolved oxygen (O2) is analyzed here to provide additional insight into PSW physics
  and biology, pathways, and evolution. O2 observations are analyzed between 2003
  and 2021 from the Joint Ocean Ice Study/Beaufort Gyre Observing System (JOIS/BGOS)
  field program, which samples CB hydrographic and biogeochemical properties. In the
  central CB, warming of the PSW layer over 2003--2021 has been accompanied by O2
  decreases over this time in the layer. Nutrients and other biogeochemical properties
  are analyzed to quantify the combined influences of both physical changes and biological
  changes on the evolution of O2 concentrations in the CB PSW. In the upper portion
  of the PSW, O2 decreases can be entirely accounted for by surface warming (and corresponding
  decrease in O2 solubility) of its source waters in the Chukchi Sea region. In the
  deeper portion of the PSW layer, the observed O2 changes are larger, and are accounted
  for by a combination of the decreased solubility effect due to warming, and increased
  organic matter breakdown in warmer waters. Decreasing O2 in a warming Arctic Ocean
  is consonant with O2 trends in the warming global oceans, and highlights the need
  for continued observations and analyses.

abstract: Observations indicate that symmetric instability is active in the East Greenland
  Current during strong northerly wind events. Theoretical considerations suggest
  that mesoscale baroclinic instability may also be enhanced during these events.
  An ensemble of idealized numerical ocean models forced with northerly winds shows
  that the short time-scale response (from 10 days to 3 weeks) to the increased baroclinicity
  of the flow is the excitation of symmetric instability, which sets the potential
  vorticity of the flow to zero. The high latitude of the current means that the zero
  potential vorticity state has low stratification, and symmetric instability destratifies
  the water column. On longer time scales (greater than 4 weeks), baroclinic instability
  is excited and the associated slumping of isopycnals restratifies the water column.
  Eddy-resolving models that fail to resolve the submesoscale should consider using
  submesoscale parameterizations to prevent the formation of overly stratified frontal
  systems following down-front wind events. The mixed layer in the current deepens
  at a rate proportional to the square root of the time-integrated wind stress. Peak
  water mass transformation rates vary linearly with the time-integrated wind stress.
  Mixing rates saturate at high wind stresses during wind events of a fixed duration
  which means increasing the peak wind stress in an event leads to no extra mixing.
  Using ERA5 reanalysis data we estimate that between 0.9 Sv and 1.0 Sv of East Greenland
  Coastal Current Waters are produced by mixing with lighter surface waters during
  wintertime due to down-front wind events. Similar amounts of East Greenland-Irminger
  Current water are produced.

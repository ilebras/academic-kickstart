abstract: The OOI Biogeochemical Sensor Data Best Practices and User Guide is intended
  to provide  current and prospective users of data generated by biogeochemical sensors
  deployed on the  Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) arrays with the information
  and guidance needed for them  to ensure that the data is science-ready. This guide
  is aimed at researchers with an interest or  some experience in ocean biogeochemical
  processes. We expect that users of this guide will  have some background in oceanography,
  however we do not assume any prior experience  working with biogeochemical sensors
  or their data.    While initially envisioned as a ``cookbook'' for end users seeking
  to work with OOI  biogeochemical (BGC) sensor data, our Working Group and Beta Testers
  realized that the  processing required to meet the specific needs of all end users
  across a wide range of potential  scientific applications and combinations of OOI
  BGC data from different sensors and platforms  couldn't be synthesized into a single
  ``recipe''. We therefore provide here the background  information and principles
  needed for the end user to successfully identify and understand all  the available
  ``ingredients'' (data), the types of ``cooking'' (end user processing) that are  recommended
  to prepare them, and a few sample ``recipes'' (worked examples) to support end  users
  in developing their own ``recipes'' consistent with the best practices presented
  here.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive guide to each of these sensors,
  but rather a synthesis  of the key information to support OOI BGC sensor data users
  in preparing science-ready data  products. In instances when more in-depth information
  might be helpful, references and links  have been provided both within each chapter
  and in the Appendix.

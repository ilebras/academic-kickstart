**Unfortunately, I am not currently accepting MIT-WHOI Joint program graduate students. Please see for this year's opportunities [here](https://mit.whoi.edu/admissions/research-opportunities/) - I encourage you to reach out to my colleagues!**

#I am hoping to build a diverse group of researchers who are passionate about applying physics and mathematics to our understanding of the ocean. Feel free to get in touch if you are interested in joining the research group and/or learning more about our work!

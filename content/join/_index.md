I am hoping to build a diverse group of researchers who are passionate about applying physics and 
mathematics to our understanding of the ocean.

**Unfortunately, I am not currently accepting MIT-WHOI Joint program graduate students. Please see for this year's opportunities [here](https://mit.whoi.edu/admissions/research-opportunities/) - I encourage you to reach out to my colleagues at WHOI!**

Additional resources:

- WHOI has an excellent [Postdoctoral Scholar Program](https://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8021).

- Prospective graduate students should apply to the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program](http://mit.whoi.edu/).

- There are several opportunities for undergraduate students at WHOI:
    - [Summer Student Fellowship ](https://www.whoi.edu/main/summer-student-fellowship)
    - [Partnership Education Program](https://www.woodsholediversity.org/pep/)
    - [Semester at WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/educate/undergraduate-programs/semester-at-whoi/)
